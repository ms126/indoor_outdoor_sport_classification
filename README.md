# CNN Indoor/Outdoor Sport Classification

## Project Overview:
The goal is to classify sports images as either indoor (0) or outdoor (1) using deep learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a dataset of sports images categorized by environment type to evaluate its classification performance.

## Data Overview:
The dataset consists of images of athletes participating in various sports, categorized into indoor and outdoor environments. The images are organized into train, test, and validation folders. An example notebook with data loaders is provided in notebooks/data_loader.ipynb
